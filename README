Darm is an ARM disassembly library released under the WTFPL.

I'm not an ARM expert, nor do I do much work in ARM. I am unsure of the
accuracy of this library. I am releasing it as I haven't been able to find
a similarily licensed ARM disassembly library for C.

Darm does not disassemble THUMB instructions.
